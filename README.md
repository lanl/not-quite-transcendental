Reference Implementations of Not-Quite-Transcendental Functions

## Introduction

This is the companion repository for [ArXiv:2206.08957](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08957). 
Here we present
the reference impementations for not-quite-transendental functions as
well as machinery to time them. For completeness, we also include the
paper in TeX in the paper subdirectory. The logarithms are in
`src/logs.hpp`, where we include a portable version as well as a very
performant version based on integer aliasing.

## Dependencies

To enable performance portability, we utilize the Kokkos library,
included as a submodule. We use `cmake` as our build system.

## Building and running

To compile for CPU, this is enough:
```bash
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake -DUSE_CUDA=OFF src
make -j
timelogs npoints
```
where here `npoints` is the number of points to use. Use a number large enough to saturate your target architecture. If you want to compile for GPU, change `-DUSE_CUDA` to `ON`.

## Building the paper

If you have `latexmk`, just type `make` in the `paper` directory.

# Report Number

The paper is authorized for unlimited release with LA-UR-22-25573.
